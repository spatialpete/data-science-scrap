testing / following examples online of data science stuff

to do (cityworksupervised.ipynb):
- Clean bad data
    - if NAN, blank, empty string then remove that row
- Map results/outliers in ArcGIS Pro / ArcGIS Online
- Have a confidence value, if that is not reached, re-run analysis until it is reached, or notify of failure
- Pull live data from Cityworks EURL into Pandas
Nice to haves:
- Morans I
